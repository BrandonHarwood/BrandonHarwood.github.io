You're probably looking at the code because you want to learn more about how the website was made. That's an AWESOME way to learn if you're starting out in HMTL or CSS (or if you're someone reviewing my portfolio, an AWESOME way to learn about me!). Either way, if you're interested in learning about the specific tools and what resources I used to make this portfolio, feel free to look my site colophon! It's the first post in my blog. :)

            <p>Hackathons are the epitome of student innovation. Let's start one. Lets Hack North Texas!</p>
            <p>I really want to bring the hackathon scene to UNT. It's a dream of mine to see a huge building filled with students from all over the US, engaging and learning with large minded goals. So <a href="http://www.hacknt.com">I'm starting one.</a></p>
            <p>In-case you don't know, hackathons are best thought of as weekend long invention marathons, where students come in on Friday evening and work, collaborate, and have fun until Sunday evening. Hacking in this context means quickly and intelligently creating a real application that others can use. Teams of two to six students work together over a weekend to develop a prototype of an application or invention (whether digital or physical), learning about new technologies and making friends on the way. Hackathons are an amazing opportunity for students to gain real-world experience, learn and collaborate with not only college students, but company sponsors as well. </p>
            <p>I have a lot of great plans for Hack North Texas, it's going to be an awesome event. We're still in the early stages, but I can already see a great directors board coming together. If you're a UNT interested in applying for a director or assistant director, <a href="https://untadc.typeform.com/to/EUOYHq">you can do so here!</a> And if you think your company would like to work with us, <a href="http://hacknt.com/sponsor.html">we're always looking for partners and sponsors!</a></p>
