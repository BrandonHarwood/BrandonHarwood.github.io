You're probably looking at the code because you want to learn more about how the website was made. That's an AWESOME way to learn if you're starting out in HMTL or CSS (or if you're someone reviewing my portfolio, an AWESOME way to learn about me!). Either way, if you're interested in learning about the specific tools and what resources I used to make this portfolio, feel free to look my site colophon! It's the first post in my blog. :)

            <p>Let's talk about my new organization.</p>
            <p>Over the last few months, I noticed that there were <i>a lot</i> of students who were into either design or app/web/software development. Why wasn’t there a dedicated club where students could get projects going?
</p>
       <p>That's when I had the idea to create the Association for Design &amp; Code. The UNT D&amp;C is dedicated to getting people interested in engineering, design, or both working together early on in their career by working on projects and hosting workshops to promote education of the binding of aesthetics and engineering. We also plan to reach out to local DFW software and engineering companies to seek guidance and make professional connection. In the fall, we’re going to be hosting Hack North Texas!</p>
       <p>For being such a young club at UNT, we have already grown so much (50 members already!), and so many exciting things happening in the near and distant future. I'm so glad I get to help students at my university and I'm so glad I get to do it working with such bright minds.</p>
