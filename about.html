You're probably looking at the code because you want to learn more about how the website was made. That's an AWESOME way to learn if you're starting out in HMTL or CSS (or if you're someone reviewing my portfolio, an AWESOME way to learn about me!). Either way, if you're interested in learning about the specific tools and what resources I used to make this portfolio, feel free to look my site colophon! It's the first post in my blog. :)

                <p>I'm a senior studying psychology at the University of North Texas pursuing a career in HCI and user experience design/research. I absolutely love learning about the ergonomics of the web and applying research to design.

                <p>I’m currently working with UNT’s IT Shared Services team designing their service website’s user interface. Alongside that I’m also the Founder &amp; Presidents of UNT’s Association for Design &amp; Code!</p>

                        <br> I’m the kinda guy that looks at something that’s just “ok” and doesn’t think it’s good enough. I like to back up my decisions with data, and I enjoy the finer things in life. I’m a fan of good coffee, beer, and wine, and of course, I try to sprinkle in a little adventure here and there. When I'm not scrambling around putting together website while or running an organization or taking care of my roommate's dogs, I like to play scary video games, shoot some photos, travel.</p>

                        <br>The Association for Design &amp; Code is dedicated to bringing engineers and designers together early on in their career to work on projects together and learn a bit more about the other side of development. We also host speakers and workshops to help people learn the fundamentals of app and website development! In Fall 2016, we plan on throwing Hack North Texas; a nation wide hackathon promoting the collaboration between designers and engineers.</p>
