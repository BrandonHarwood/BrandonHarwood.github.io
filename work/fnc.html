You're probably looking at the code because you want to learn more about how the website was made. That's an AWESOME way to learn if you're starting out in HMTL or CSS (or if you're someone reviewing my portfolio, an AWESOME way to learn about me!). Either way, if you're interested in learning about the specific tools and what resources I used to make this portfolio, feel free to look my site colophon! It's the first post in my blog. :)

            <p>Fujitsu’s extranet, specifically the Customer Service Request (CSR), is used by clients working with Fujitsu whenever they have a problem or need to check the status of an order. When I was brought onto the team they were in the process of remodeling the 15 year old website to better-fit Fujitsu Global design standards. My goal for the CSR section of the website was to figure out usability problems, come up with workarounds, and re-design it to fit said standards.</p>
               <div class="small-12 columns display">
               <p>To summarize, I turned this:</p>

                    <div class="device">

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="small-12 columns display">
               <p>Into this:</p>
                <div class="device-mockup" data-device="macbook" data-orientation="portrait" data-color="black">
                    <div class="device">

            <h1 class="tk-calluna">The Process:</h1>
            <p>My first step was to analyze what was wrong with the old version. A few things stick out right away that are obvious; like the fact that it was a 15 year old website, and it didn’t follow many modern web standards. So following that, the team and I analyzed a bit more and concluded that the following were the most prominent problems, and came up with solutions.</p>
